Hamiltonian Descent Methods implementation

## Roadmap

 [-] Implement HGD, SGD (w/ momentum), ODE solver for continuous dynamics (scipy.integrate.odeint)
 [-] Look for functions with pathological behavious for classical methods (sublinear instead of linear)
 [-] Discretization plots
 [-] Analysis - Try to start from momentum, show its convergence analysis, then introduce continuous hamiltonian, then discretize to get 3 methods.
